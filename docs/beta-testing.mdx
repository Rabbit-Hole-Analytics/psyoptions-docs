PsyOptions is an American style options protocol built on the Solana blockchain. The principles that have guided the architecture and development of the core protocol are flexibility and composability. It is completely trustless. The core protocol makes no assumptions on how the options should be traded or priced. Options are represented as SPL Tokens, which means they can be traded on any DEX that supports SPL Tokens.

V1 will support 100% collateralized, asset settled, covered calls and secured puts.

## Trading Options

### Writing Options

To write an option, select the "Markets" at the top left bar and select the **MARKET Order Type** if there is already a desired order to be filled in the order book.

If the market for a desired strike price has not been initialized by anyone yet, one will have to first initialize the market. Follow the instructions below.

After initializing, there will be an option to place a buy/sell order at limit prices.

### Locked Collateral

One must provide collateral equal to the amount specified by the option market.

For instance, for a SOL/USDC option with underlying asset size of 100, 100 SOL would be locked in order to mint the option token. The option writer will then receive two SPL Tokens. One represents the option, which the user may sell to generate yield, while the other represents the written contract (the claim on the underlying asset) and can be exchanged for the underlying asset post expiration.

## Checking Open Positions

Click on the "Open Positions" option at the top left bar to view all current positions in the options market.

### Exercising

If the option has not expired, clicking the `Exercise` button will prompt a transaction to exercise the option.

The owning wallet must have enough of the quote asset (`contract size * strike price`) to successfully exercise.

## Initializing Markets

To create fungible option SPL Tokens for trading in the options markets, one will have to initializing a market by supplying the following values: 1) Underlying Asset; 2) Quote Asset; 3) Contract Size; 4) Strike Price and; 5) Expiration.

### How to Initialize a Market:
